   <h3><p style="color :#ffebf9">Dear Yulou, <br> <br> 
    This day is very special because an amazing boy was born.<br> 
    Even though I am not there, I want to take a part on this<br> 
    day to make it memorable. This is your first birthday<br> 
    that I will celebrate with you and I want to make it<br> 
    special. I want to wish you a good life and that you<br>
    achieve your dreams and goals. Life is really tough so I want<br> 
    you to be strong. You're a very very good friend of mine so I<br> 
    hope that you take care of your self very well. Remember that I<br> 
    will always be at your side if you need help. I will always<br>
    support you no matter what. If you have problems, don't hesitate<br> 
    to ask for my help. You are a very hardworking boy so I am sure<br> 
    that you will achieve your dreams. Oh, and thank you so much for<br> 
    not letting me be the last person to message whenever we have a<br> 
    conversation, I appreciate it so much really!‚∏ú(ÔΩ°ÀÉ ·µï ÀÇ )‚∏ù‚ô°<br> 
    I see you as a very caring and loving person and I Wish you<br> 
    never change that. You know, you're very different from the<br> 
    other boys, to be honest, you are the very first boy I met who<br>
    is interested in politics and geography. It is very hard to find<br> 
    a boy like you who maintains a good background as a teenager.<br>
    Whenever you share your good moments to me, I really feel like<br> 
    I am valued. You are very dear for me. I admire your passion in<br> 
    everything you like and the way that you speak to me about it<br> 
    with enthusiasm is very heart-warming. I don't know but whenever<br> 
    I talk to you, something that is broken inside me has been fixed.<br> 
    Ever since we started talking, my life has been easy. I think it's <br> 
    because you bring so much positive thing in your life and you've<br>
    been sharing it with other people so I hope that you are always<br> 
    happy. You are someone that I truly trust. I like it when I can<br> 
    talk to you about everything without getting judge. I feel like<br> 
    I can share my whole personality with you without getting<br>
    uncomfortable. You are the safest person I could be with.<br>
    I hope that this day will be great for you. Enjoy your day<br> 
    with your family and friends!!‚∏ú(ÔΩ°ÀÉ ·µï ÀÇ )‚∏ù‚ô°<br> 
    Happy Birthday again Yulou<br>
    I love you. ‡¨™(‡πë‚Ä¢·¥ó‚Ä¢‡πë)‡¨ì ‚ô°</p></h3>
